## **Logistic Distribution**

- The logistic distribution is used in machine learning and deep learning models. It is used as an activation function in neural networks.
- It is a symmetric distribution that is used to describe growth.
- It is used in the field of economics to describe the growth of a population.
- It has three parameters:
  - `loc`: Mean of the distribution.
  - `scale`: Standard deviation of the distribution.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
- The `np.random.logistic()` method is used to get a Logistic Distribution.

## **Multinomial Distribution**

- Multinomial Distribution is a generalization of binomial distribution.
- It describes the probability of observing counts among a number of categories.
- It has three parameters:
  - `n`: Number of experiments.
  - `pvals`: Probabilities of each of the outcomes.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
- The `np.random.multinomial()` method is used to get a Multinomial Distribution.

## **Summary**

- Logistic Distribution is used in machine learning and deep learning models.
- It is used as an activation function in neural networks.
- Use the `np.random.logistic()` method to get a Logistic Distribution.
- Multinomial Distribution is a generalization of binomial distribution.
- It describes the probability of observing counts among a number of categories.
- Use the `np.random.multinomial()` method to get a Multinomial Distribution.

`Note: Multinomial samples will NOT produce a single value! They will produce one value for each pval.`

`Note: As they are generalization of binomial distribution their visual representation and similarity of normal distribution is same as that of multiple binomial distributions.`
