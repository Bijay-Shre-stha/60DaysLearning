## **Exponential Distribution**

- The exponential distribution is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
- It is the continuous counterpart of the geometric distribution, which is instead discrete.
- The exponential distribution is widely used in the field of reliability.
- It has two parameters:
  - `scale`: Inverse of the rate of events.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
The `np.random.exponential()` method is used to get an Exponential Distribution.

## **Chi Square Distribution**

- The chi-square distribution is used in hypothesis testing.
- It is used to determine the goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical distribution.
- It has one parameter:
  - `df`: Degrees of freedom.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
The `np.random.chisquare()` method is used to get a Chi Square Distribution.

## **Summary**

- Exponential Distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
- It is the continuous counterpart of the geometric distribution.
- Use the `np.random.exponential()` method to get an Exponential Distribution.
- Chi Square Distribution is used in hypothesis testing.
- It is used to determine the goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical distribution.
- Use the `np.random.chisquare()` method to get a Chi Square Distribution.

`Note: The chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.`
