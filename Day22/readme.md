## **Random**

- Random module is used to generate random numbers.
- It is used to generate random numbers for various purposes like generating random number sequence, generating random numbers for data encryption, etc.
- It means something that cannot be predicted logically.

## **Data Distribution**

- Data Distribution is a list of all possible values, and how often each value occurs.
- Such lists are important when working with statistics and data science.
- `Probability Density Function`: A function that describes a continuous probability. i.e. probability of all values in an array.
- `Normal Distribution`: A distribution of values that is symmetric and has a characteristic bell shape.
- `Binomial Distribution`: A distribution of values that have two possible outcomes.
- `Poisson Distribution`: A distribution of values that represent the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space.
- The sum of probabilities in a data distribution is always 1.
