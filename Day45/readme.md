# **Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection**

## **Description**

In this project, we'll work on a credit card fraud detection dataset to predict fraudulent transactions. We'll explore the dataset, clean and preprocess it, and then build a machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. This project will help you get familiar with the basics of machine learning, classification algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques.

## **Dataset**

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from the following link:

- [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Data Dictionary

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data are not provided. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features that have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Models Evaluated

Several machine learning models were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting fraudulent transactions. The following models were tested:

- LogisticRegression : 0.9473684210526315
- KNeighborsClassifier : 0.6157894736842106
- DecisionTreeClassifier : 0.9052631578947369
- RandomForestClassifier : 0.9526315789473684
- GradientBoostingClassifier : 0.9526315789473684
- GaussianNB : 0.9105263157894737
- SVC : 0.4842105263157895

## **Summary**

In this project, we worked on a credit card fraud detection dataset to predict fraudulent transactions. We explored the dataset, cleaned and preprocessed it, and then built a machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. This project helped us get familiar with the basics of machine learning, classification algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques.
