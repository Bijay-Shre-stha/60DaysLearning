**Project: Analyzing COVID-19 Data**

- **Description:** Create a Python script that analyzes COVID-19 data using Pandas.
- **Topics:** Pandas, Data Analysis, Data Visualization
- **Skills:** Data Analysis, Python Syntax, Pandas, Data Visualization

# Load the dataset

- url_confirmed = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv`

- url_deaths = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv`

- url_recovered = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv`

## **package Installation**

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## **Summary**

In this project, we'll create a Python script that analyzes COVID-19 data using Pandas. We'll read the data from a CSV file, clean and preprocess it using Pandas, and then perform various analyses like finding the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries, calculating the mortality rate, and visualizing the data using matplotlib. This project will help you understand how to work with real-world data using Pandas and visualize it for better insights.

## **Drawbacks**

- **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the analysis heavily depends on the quality of the data provided in the CSV file.
- **Data Updates:** The script may need to be updated to work with new data files or sources as the COVID-19 situation evolves.
- **Data Visualization:** The project focuses more on data analysis than advanced data visualization techniques. Additional libraries like Seaborn or Plotly can be used for more sophisticated visualizations.
