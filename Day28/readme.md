## **Rayleigh Distribution**

- The Rayleigh distribution is used in signal processing.
- It is used to model the amplitude of a signal.
- It has two parameters:
  - `scale`: The mode of the distribution.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
The `np.random.rayleigh()` method is used to get a Rayleigh Distribution.

## **Pareto Distribution**

- The Pareto distribution is used in economics.
- It is used to model the distribution of wealth.
- It has two parameters:
  - `a`: Shape of the distribution.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
The `np.random.pareto()` method is used to get a Pareto Distribution.

`Noted: At unit stddev and 2 degrees of freedom rayleigh and chi square represent the same distributions.`


## **Summary**

- Rayleigh Distribution is used in signal processing.
- Use the `np.random.rayleigh()` method to get a Rayleigh Distribution.
- Pareto Distribution is used in economics.
- Use the `np.random.pareto()` method to get a Pareto Distribution.
