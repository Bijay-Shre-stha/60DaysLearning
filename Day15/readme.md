## **Project: Location Tracker Using Phone Number**

- **Project:** Location Tracker Using Phone Number
- **Description:** Create a Python script that tracks the location of a phone number using an API.
- **Topics:** Web Scraping, API Integration, phonenumbers, Geocoding
- **Skills:** Problem Solving, Python Syntax, Web Scraping, API Integration

## **package Installation**

- phonenumbers
- requests
- OpenCage
- folium

## **Summary**

In this project, we'll create a Python script that tracks the location of a phone number using an API. The script will take a phone number as input, extract the country code and phone number, use the phonenumbers library to parse the phone number, and then use an API to get the location details of the phone number. We'll use the OpenCage Geocoding API to get the latitude and longitude of the phone number's location and display it on a map using the folium library.

## **Drawbacks**

- **phonenumbers:** Doesn't provide real-time location tracking. It only provides the country code and phone number parsing functionality.
- **OpenCage API:** Limited free usage. You may need to sign up for a paid plan for extensive usage.
