## **Project: Data Visualization**

- **Data Visualization** is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.

### **Learned About**

- `Plot` is a graphical representation of data.
- `join plot` ` is a combination of scatter plot and histogram.
- `pair plot` is a pair-wise scatter plot.
- `Facet Grid` is a multi-plot grid for plotting conditional relationships.
- `Box Plot` ` is a way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
- `Strip Plot` is a way of plotting data points on top of each other to show the distribution of the data.
- `Violin Plot` is a method of plotting numeric data and can be considered a combination of the box plot with a kernel density plot.
- `Pair Plot` is a pair-wise scatter plot.
- `andrews_curves` is a method for visualizing data by plotting the curves of multivariate data.
- `parallel_coordinates` is a method for visualizing high-dimensional geometry and analyzing multivariate data.
- `radviz` is a way of visualizing multi-dimensional data in a 2D space.

## **Summary**

- **Data Visualization** is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.
