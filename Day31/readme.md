## **Zipf Distribution**

- Zipf distribution is a discrete distribution named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf. It is also known as the zeta distribution. It is a continuous probability distribution that satisfies Zipf's law, which states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.
- It has two parameters:
  - `a`: Distribution parameter.
  - `size`: The shape of the returned array.
- The `np.random.zipf()` method is used to get a Zipf Distribution.

`Note: In a collection, the nth common word is 1/n times as common as the most common word.
Eg: The 2nd common word is 1/2 times as common as the most common word.`
