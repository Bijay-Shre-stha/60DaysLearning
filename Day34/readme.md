## **ufunc Products**

- **ufunc Products** are used to find the product of the elements of an array.
- The `multiply()` function returns the product of the elements of the array.
- The `prod()` function returns the product of the elements of the array.
- The `cumprod()` function returns the cumulative product of the elements along a given axis.

## **ufunc Differences**

- **ufunc Differences** are used to find the difference between the elements of an array.
- The `subtract()` function subtracts the elements of the second array from the elements of the first array.
- The `diff()` function calculates the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.
- The `ediff1d()` function calculates the difference between consecutive elements of an array.
- The `gradient()` function calculates the gradient of the elements of the array.

## **ufunc LCM**

- **ufunc LCM** is used to find the Least Common Multiple of the elements of an array.
- The `lcm()` function returns the Least Common Multiple of the elements of the array.
- The `reduce()` function applies the ufunc repeatedly to the elements of the array until only a single result remains.

## **ufunc GCD**

- **ufunc GCD** is used to find the Greatest Common Divisor of the elements of an array.
- The `gcd()` function returns the Greatest Common Divisor of the elements of the array.
- The `reduce()` function applies the ufunc repeatedly to the elements of the array until only a single result remains.
