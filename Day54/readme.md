# **Project: Simple Weather Forecast**

## **Description**

In this project, we'll work on a simple weather forecast dataset to predict the weather condition based on temperature and humidity. We'll explore the dataset, clean and preprocess it, and then build a machine learning model to predict the weather condition. This project will help you get familiar with the basics of machine learning, classification algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques.

## Data Dictionary

- Outlook: A forecast or prediction about how the weather will develop over the day.
- Temperature: Measure of hotness or coldness
- Humidity: Amount of water vapor in the air
- Wind: Presence or absence of wind
- Play: Is it ideal to play outdoors.
