# Infosec Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of information security (infosec). Infosec is a critical area that focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, changes, disruption, and other threats. It covers various specializations, including network security, application security, security testing, digital forensics, and incident response.

## Introduction to Infosec

Information security (infosec) involves protecting data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The core principles of infosec are encapsulated in the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

## Risk Management

Effective infosec practices involve identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and managing risks. This process includes:

- Identifying risks
- Analyzing their impact and likelihood
- Evaluating and prioritizing risks
- Mitigating or transferring risks
- Continuously monitoring them

## Role of Penetration Testers

Penetration testers (pentesters) identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in systems. Their activities can range from white-box tests to more covert operations that simulate real-world attacks. Pentesters provide insights into security weaknesses and recommend remediation measures.

## Red Team vs. Blue Team

- **Red Team**: Simulates attackers attempting to break into systems. Activities include penetration testing and social engineering.
- **Blue Team**: Focuses on defending against attacks, enhancing defensive measures, analyzing risks, and responding to security incidents.

## Getting Started with a Pentest Distro

Aspiring penetration testers should familiarize themselves with various technologies and operating systems, particularly Linux and Windows. Key steps include:

1. **Choosing a Distro**: Many Debian-based distributions come preloaded with essential tools. Testers can customize their VMs based on preferences.
2. **Setting Up the Environment**: Penetration testing can be conducted on local VMs, cloud-based Linux boxes, or client-owned workstations, depending on the assessment's scope.
