# **Project: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**

## **Description**

In this project, we'll work on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict the survival of passengers based on various features. We'll explore the dataset, clean and preprocess it, and then build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived or not. This project will help you get familiar with the basics of machine learning, classification algorithms, and data preprocessing techniques.

## **Topics**

- Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Machine Learning
- Classification

## **Skills**

- Data Analysis
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Classification

## **Dataset**

The dataset for this project can be downloaded from the following link:

- [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Data Dicitonary

- PassengerId: A column added by Kaggle to identify each row and make submissions easier
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived or not and the value we are predicting (0=No, 1=Yes)
- Pclass: The class of the ticket the passenger purchased (1=1st, 2=2nd, 3=3rd)
- sibsp: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic
- Parch: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: The passenger’s ticket number
- Fare: The fare the passenger paid
- Cabin: The passenger’s cabin number
- Embarked: The port where the passenger embarked (C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton)

## **Summary**

In this project, we'll work on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict the survival of passengers based on various features. We'll explore the dataset, clean and preprocess it, and then build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived or not.
