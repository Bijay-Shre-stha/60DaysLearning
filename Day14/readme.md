## **Summary**

In this project, we'll create a Python script that blocks access to certain websites by redirecting them to a local server. The script will modify the system's host file to redirect requests to specific websites to a local server running on the loopback address. By running the script in the background, we can effectively block access to the specified websites on the system.
